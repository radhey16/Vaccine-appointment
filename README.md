## Motivation
This project will allow you to practice the final stages of User-Centred Design 
methodology: creating a working prototype and possibly usability testing.
## Description
The implementation is expected to be performed using HTML/CSS/JS, so that you obtain
an application that can run in a regular browser. 
Available appointment times: assume the appointments are available on days of the
month divisible by 2 at 10:00, on days divisible by 3 – at 11:20, on those divisible by 5 –
at 14:10, on those divisible by 7 – at 15:40, and on those divisible by 11 – at 17:30. E.g.,
on August 15, the appointments are available at 11:20 and at 14:10; on Aug 21 – 11:20
and 15:40, and so on.
Confirming the scheduled appointment(s), etc.: if necessary, you may either display the
summary at the end of the interaction, or you can use an alert window explaining what a 
2
real system will do. That alert window will not be considered a part of the real
application and will be there simply to illustrate if your application was able to collect all
the relevant data from the user. Again, this information may be already conveyed to the
user in a different manner during their use session, and no additional alert windows may
be needed.
